## Overview

The *Griffin+* logging subsystem is a simple, but modular extensible logging facility that focusses on applications built on the .NET framework. It addresses many issues that have arised during multiple years of developing .NET libraries and applications. The logging subsystem is part of the *Griffin+* library suite and used in other *Griffin+* projects to channelize and process log message streams. Nevertheless the logging subsystem can be used in other projects as well as it does not have any dependencies that would clutter other projects.

## Supported Platforms

The logging subsystem is entirely written in .NET Standard 2.0.

Therefore it should work on the following platforms (or higher):
- .NET Framework 4.6.1
- .NET Core 2.0
- Mono 5.4
- Xamarin iOS 10.14
- Xamarin Mac 3.8
- Xamarin Android 8.0
- Universal Windows Platform (UWP) 10.0.16299
